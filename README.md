# AI-Driven-Crop-Disease-Detection
Agriculture is vital for food production and economic growth, playing a crucial role in sustaining populations and fostering development globally. The agriculture field encounters several issues in preserving crop health and optimizing yield. Plant diseases profoundly affect agricultural productivity, underscoring the critical requirement for efficient detection and management strategies in farming practices. Traditional methods provide timely and accurate disease identification. Artificial intelligence (AI) in farming addresses these issues and identifies diseases accurately. Although there are concerns about data accessibility, scalability of models, and the necessity for customized algorithms suited to distinct agricultural environment, the research work aims to develop a deep learning architecture for the automated detection and classification of leaf diseases. The methodology involves utilizing a diverse dataset of plant diseases, feature extraction and implementing the Xception model for further classification. The analysis of this algorithm reveals its efficiency in the precise identification and categorization of leaf diseases, highlighting its potential for practical adoption in agricultural contexts.
